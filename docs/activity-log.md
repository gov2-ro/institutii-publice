## 2026-10-25 — Spec and brief: "Structura statului" view
**Done**
- Measured the parent graph in `institutii.json`. The ANAF parent link is one level deep. There are 3,296
  roots: 73 central bodies, the rest UATs. MEC has 6,036 children, MS 214. 5,657 records have two parents.
  11,861 records have no CIF, and 3,544 of them can get a parent from their family (≥ 90% agreement).
- Wrote `docs/specs/structura-statului.md` and `docs/briefs/structura-statului-v1.md`. Started
  `docs/BACKLOG.md` and this log.

**Hard**
- The top layer (Parlament, Președinție, Guvern…) is not in any source. It must be curated by hand.
- Some placements are disputed (CNCAN, ANL, CNAS, ARACIS, ICR). They carry a note in the mapping.

**Decided** (with the owner)
- The top layer follows the Constitution. *Why:* the Constitution is a citable, stable reference. The cost of
  the alternative: a "who controls it" view needs research per body and changes with each government.
- The new view replaces "Autoritate → subordonate". The new tree contains every node of the old tree.
- Inferred parents wait for phase 2. Version 1 shows only ANAF data.
- Local administration is part of the view. Only this view shows the UAT → subordinates level.
- The mapping lives in `consolidate.py` and is keyed by CIF. `data/` is not in git, and CIFs are stable.
